# 🤖 Codebot - Your Offline Code Assistant



**Codebot** is a powerful **100% in-browser** development tool designed to help programmers clean, explain, and fix their code snippets quickly and privately.

Unlike cloud-based assistants, Codebot operates completely **offline**, ensuring your code never leaves your browser.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Zero AI, 100% Privacy:** No external API calls. All code analysis is performed locally, guaranteeing maximum confidentiality.
* **Instant Assistance:** The ideal tool for fast debugging and immediate code comprehension.
* **Multi-Language Support:** Analyzes code in several popular programming languages.
* **Currently supports up to 100 lines of code** (with plans for future expansion!).

## ✨ Functionality

Codebot offers two main actions accessible via a simple and intuitive interface:

| Button | Description | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Check & Fix** | Analyzes the entered code, locates common syntax and logic errors, explains where the error is, and attempts to fix it. | Quick debugging and snippet correction. |
| **Explain Code** | Provides a structured, step-by-step explanation of how the code works. | Rapid understanding of logic and flow. |

## 💻 Supported Languages

Codebot currently supports the analysis of the following languages:

* JavaScript
* React (JSX)
* Python
* Java
* C++
* Go

*(We are working to expand this list and improve the depth of analysis for each language.)*

## 🛠️ Architecture and Technology

Codebot is built with a focus on performance and local execution.

* **Front-end:** [Add your front-end stack here, e.g., HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS / React]
* **Static Analysis:** [Briefly explain how you handle the analysis *without* AI, e.g., "It utilizes language-specific code parsing libraries executed via WebAssembly."]
* **Core Libraries:** [Add key libraries like CodeMirror/Monaco Editor, linters, parsers used]

## 💡 Contributions and Roadmap

The Codebot project is under active development. Here are some of our next goals:

1.  **Limit Increase:** Surpassing the 100-line code limit.
2.  **Optimization:** Adding a "Suggest Optimization" feature to improve efficiency.
3.  **Wasm Integration:** Implementing WebAssembly for more powerful and faster analysis.
